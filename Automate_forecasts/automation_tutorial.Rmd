# Introduction

Workflow automation is key to making a forecast that is run every day, takes in new observations, updates parameters and initial conditions and produces a new forecast. And the automation means all of this is done without you needing to click a button every day.

# The environment - Docker

To automate your forecast, the workflow needs to be fully reproducible. The environment/set up, packages, file paths need to be set up in a way that can be reproduced every day in the same way. As part of this reproducibility we will use a Docker container:

> A container is a standard unit of software that packages up code and all its dependencies so the application runs quickly and reliably from one computing environment to another. Containers isolate software from its environment and ensure that it works uniformly despite differences for instance between development and staging.

We will utilise a container from the `RockerProject` a Docker container that has R installed as well as some pre-installed packages. The NEON forecast Challenge has a container available which has the neon4cast package (plus tidyverse and other commonly used packages) already installed.

# The platform - Github Actions

There are a few ways that the running of a script can be automated but we will be using the Github Actions tools. Actions allow you to run a workflow based on a trigger, which in our case will be a time (but could be when you push or pull to a directory). Read more about [Github Actions](https://docs.github.com/en/actions/learn-github-actions/understanding-github-actions).

To start off with Github actions you need a workflow yaml file. Yaml files are computer readable 'instructions' that essentially say what the Action needs to do.

Every time an action is triggered to start it will open a Linux machine environment and from this we can give it a series of instructions to get to our forecast submission. Below is an example of what your yaml file might look like to run an automated forecast.

A basic description of a Github action:

> You can configure a GitHub Actions *workflow* to be triggered when an event occurs in your repository, such as a pull request being opened or a timer. Your workflow contains one or more *jobs* which can run in sequential order or in parallel. Each job will run inside its own virtual machine or container, and has one or more *steps* that either run a script that you define or run an action.

-   `on` tells you what triggers the workflow - here we use a `schedule` to determine the action based on a `cron` schedule (i.e. a timer) to run a 12 (UTC), everyday. You can update this to run on a different schedule based on timing codes found in <https://crontab.guru>.
-   `jobs` this is what you are telling the machine to do. You can see that within the job we have other instructions that tell the machine what `container` to use and the various `steps` in the job. We use a container `image` from eco4cast that has the neon4cast package plus others installed (`eco4cast/rocker-neon4cast`).
    -   The first is to `checkout repo` which uses a pre-made action `checkout` to get a copy of the Github repo.
    -   Next, within the container, we run the R script `run_forecast.R` - this is your forecast code that generates a forecast file and has code to submit the saved forecast to the Challenge.

Note: (An example forecast script is included in the repository but you can modify this with the code you develop during the workshop)

Note: the indentation matters, make sure the indentation is as formatted here!

Because of the workflow_dispatch this will run everyday, submitting your forecast to the Challenge. As long as your run_forecast.R has all the code in to do this!

```         
on:
  workflow_dispatch:
  schedule:
  - cron: "0 12 * * *"

jobs:
  run_forecast:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    container:
      image: eco4cast/rocker-neon4cast
    steps:
      - name: Checkout repo
        uses: actions/checkout@v2
        with:
          fetch-depth: 0
          
      - name: Run automatic prediction file
        run: Rscript forecast_code.R 
```

Once all the instructions/steps are run the container will close. When a container closes all data created (like the "aquatics-2023-07-22-example_ID.csv" file) will be lost. If you need to retrieve anything from an automated Github Action it needs to be pushed back to Github or to a remote location (e.g. cloud storage).

This workflow file should be saved into a sub-directory called `.github/workflows` in the parent directory.

# Let's try and put this together

## Writing a yaml

Start by writing our yaml file:

```{r}
# 1. Make directory
parent_dir <- here::here()
dir.create(file.path(parent_dir,'_github/workflows'), recursive = T)

# 2. Create yaml file
# Copy chunk above into new text file (make sure the indentation is the same) and save into the .github/workflows directory

# 3. Commit changes and push to Github
```

## Enable Actions

In Github go to your repository and navigate to the ACTIONS tab and make sure they are enabled. If they're not go to Settings \> Actions \> General and check the Allow actions and reusable workflows.

## Test the Action

-   Go back to Actions.
-   Click on the workflow in the left panel `.github/workflows/run_forecast.yaml`
-   Test the workflow runs by using the Run workflow button \> Run workflow
-   Your job has been requested and will initiate soon
-   The progress of the job can be checked by clicking on it (Yellow running, Green completed, Red failed)
-   You can view the output of the job including what is produced in the console by clicking on the relevent sections of the job

You now have a fully automated forecast workflow!
